# Report

This project aims to redesign various pages of Steam to make the UX and UI more consistent
that the current website.

## Problems of Current Website

- Too many different shades of blue
- Inconsistent components, you can come across to a new button every few pages
- Verbose and repetitive way of conveying information

## Fixes

### Navbar

- Made the background transparent for a less obtrusive look
- Centered hamburger vertically, put it on the right side for easier access, since
  most people are right handed

### Hamburger

- Reduced the number of links, put the most important links instead
- Removed footers from the bottom of the hamburger
- Added a more prominent sign in button

### Hero

- Removed categories, put the highlighted products instead moved search bar below the highlighted products
